# Dungeon Crawler

## Background

Dungeon Crawler is a dungeon puzzle game that allows a user to move a player around a dungeon and try to overcome various challenges. In order to "complete" the dungeon a 'goal' needs to be completed e.g. Killing all enemies, Finding all Treasures, Finding a key to the exit. 

The program was built by myself and Austin Landry, and we utilised Java and JavaFX. We used various design patterns, drew appropriate UML diagrams

## [Demo](https://replit.com/@seanik/Dungeon-Crawler#script.bash)

The demo seems to have a bit of trouble launching Javafx in an Ubuntu window in Replit. If it does work, the screen may need to be readjusted to keep in view.

Executing the ./script.bash script will compile and launch the program.

## [Original Spec](https://github.com/sseanik/Dungeon-Crawler/blob/master/SPEC.md)

This program is based off a group project I was in 2020 for CS2511 written in Java. The specification was provided by CSE staff. Together with group project partner Austin, we wrote each `.java` file, whereas the spec and overall setup files are owned by UNSW CSE and the CS2511 course.
